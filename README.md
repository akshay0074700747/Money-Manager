# Money-Manager
My first android application project for managing and tracking expences and income

Managing our finances can be overwhelming and stressful, which is why i designed this app to simplify the process and help us take control of our money.
With this app, we can easily track our income and expenses, set budgets and financial goals, and receive personalized insights and recommendations to improve our financial health.
I designed this app using the flutter framework and it uses the google firebase as its backend.
